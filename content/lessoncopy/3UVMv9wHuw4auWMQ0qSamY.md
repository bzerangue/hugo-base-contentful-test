  ## Field validation
  Creating validation rules at the field level ensures that information is handled consistently. An example of why this is important is that you could prevent malformed data from crashing an application in production.

  Some other common validation rules for fields include character limits and enforcing specific values, such as `Beginner`, `Intermediate`, or `Advanced`. The following resources have a complete list of fields and available field validations:
