  In this course, we went through the basic concepts of Contentful:

  - Contentfulâ€™s API-first approach facilitates connecting Contentful with third-party systems
  - Contentful has no built-in templates and provides JSON as well as binaries as outputs
  - A client application created with Contentful is in full control of its presentation
  - Data modeling with Contentful uses flexible content types that are decoupled from presentation
  - The Contentful web app is an easy-to-use editor for authoring content

  If you have any questions, head over to the [Contentful Community](https://www.contentfulcommunity.com/) forum or [contact support](https://www.contentful.com/support/).
